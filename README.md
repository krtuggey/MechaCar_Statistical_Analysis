## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- The vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and AWD variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero in this situation. This is because the p-value value is less than zero.
- This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes somewhat effectively: the R squared value is 71.49% percent, meaning that 71.49% of predictions will be correct using the linear model.
